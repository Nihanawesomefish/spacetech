        Satellites Are Launched by Rockets
        All satellites are launched into space through one of two methods: hitching a ride on a rocket or riding in the cargo bay of a space shuttle. In order to make it past the thickest part of the atmosphere and conserve fuel, or propellant, the rockets take off at a 90-degree angle. The rockets must have enough propellant to not only penetrate the thickest part of the atmosphere, but also fight against the pull of Earth’s gravity.
        
        Inertial Guidance Systems Adjust Rocket Positioning
        Immediately after launch, the rocket makes adjustments based on calculations made by the inertial guidance system. An inertial guidance system is an advanced navigation tool that utilizes a computer, motion sensors, and rotation sensors simultaneously to calculate the orientation and velocity of the rocket. This navigation system allows the rocket to make adjustments to its position without taking the time to communicate back to the base station. Once the atmosphere has thinned, it releases the satellite. The satellite is propelled by the rocket’s momentum and simultaneously pulled toward Earth’s gravity. This balance allows the satellite to enter into orbit.
